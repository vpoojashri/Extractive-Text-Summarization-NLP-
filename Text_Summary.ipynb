              "'Brihadeeshwara Temple (Peruvudaiyar Kovil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Thanjavur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajesvaram. It is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture during the Chola period. Built by emperor Raja Raja Chola I and completed in 1010 AD, the temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Living Chola Temples\", with the other two being the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram andAiravatesvara temple.\\n\\nbig-temple-thanjavur\\n\\nThe temple stands amidst fortified walls that were probably added in the 16th century. The vimanam (temple tower) is 216 ft (66 m) high and is the tallest in the world. The Kumbam (the apex or the bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons. There is a big statue of Nandi (sacred bull), carved out of a single rock measuring about 16 ft (4.9 m) long and 13 ft (4.0 m) high at the entrance. The entire temple structure is made out of granite, the nearest sources of which are about 60 km to the west of temple. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nbig-temple-thanjavur\\n\\nTemple Timeline\\nThe much celebrated \\'Ponnambalam\\' (temple with golden roof) at Thillai (Chidambaram) was just a few hours of journey away. Thiruvarur, the most important \\'Sapta Vitanka Sthalam’, which had the patronage of the Cholas right from the days of Manuneedhi Cholan and Musukuntha Cholan, was also nearby. So were numerous temples referred to as \\'paadal Petra Sthalangals\\' - temples where the Saivite saints Appar, Sundarar, Sambandhar and Manickavasagar had sung Thevaram hymns (religious hymns praising the deeds of Lord Shiva). Then, what made Rajaraja Cholan build a massive temple in his capital city?\\n\\nFew centuries back, the Pallavas had given a new dimension to art and architecture. Under their patronage rose the majestic Rathas, Shore Temple and Yali Caves at Mamallapuram. Rajasimha Pallavan built two splendid temples in Kanchipuram \\'Paramesvara Vinnagaram\\' and \\'Kailasanathar Kovil\\'. The latter, dedicated to Lord Siva, held Rajaraja Cholan\\'s attention. He called it \\'kachchipettu Periya Thali\\' (The Big Temple of Kanchipuram). Rajaraja Cholan\\'s dreams and aspirations were always huge. The visionary he was in all matters, there is no wonder that he envisaged a huge temple to celebrate the power of divinity.\\n\\nMany a people, have wondered why he chose to build an imposing monument. Did he want to showcase the power and might of his empire by building something colossal? Did he want to stamp his authority and tell the world, \\'Look what I have accomplished?\\' Did he want to get rid of sins wrought by years of warfare or get a magical cure to a disease of unknown origin, as some people claim? May be the reason was simple. He wanted to show the whole world the towering presence of God that is everlasting against human life that is highly evanescent.\\n\\n'"
